- 👋 Hi, I’m @donglebender
- 👀 I’m interested in skiing, motorcycling, and trying to make tech more accessible and usable for preventing further deterioration of the environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create full-stack websites.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects for networking deployable sensors back to a main hub, for tracking wildfires.
